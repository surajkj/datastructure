### Introduction
Data structure is simply an arrangement of data in the main memory, so that operations can be performed efficiently.

### Stack vs Heap memory

| Stack memory                                 | Heap memory                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------- |
| This is organised memory                     | This is unorganised memory                  |
| Also known as static allocation              | Also known as dynamic allocation            |
| Takes less time to access this memory        | Takes more time to access this memory       |
| Memory once allocated cannot be changed      | Allocated memory can be altered             |
| Memory shortage problem is likely to happen  | Main issues in this is memory fragmentation |
| Memory is allocated in a contiguous block    | Memory is allocated in any random order     |

### Type of data structures
#### Physical data structures
  
#### Logical data structures
