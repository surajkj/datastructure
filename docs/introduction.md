### Introduction
Data structure is simply an arrangement of data in the main memory, so that operations can be performed efficiently.

### Stack vs Heap memory

| Stack memory                                 | Heap memory                                 |
| -------------------------------------------- |-------------------------------------------- |
| This is organised memory                     | This is unorganised memory                  |
| Also known as static allocation              | Also known as dynamic allocation            |
| Takes less time to access this memory        | Takes more time to access this memory       |
| Memory once allocated cannot be changed      | Allocated memory can be altered             |
| Memory shortage problem is likely to happen  | Main issues in this is memory fragmentation |
| Memory is allocated in a contiguous block    | Memory is allocated in any random order     |

### Type of data structures
#### Physical data structures
Physical data structure defines how the memory is organised/allocated. Ex. of this can be array or linked list

#### Logical data structures
Logical data structures are implemented using physical data structures. Ex. of logical data structure is stack, queue, tree, graph, hashtable

### Abstract datatype (ADT)
* abstract - without knowing internal details, we can use it
* datatype - representation of data & operation that can be performed on the data

Define the data, operations on the data & let it be used as a datatype, hiding the internal details. This is the concept of ADT. 
Ex. of ADt are list, set, map, tree etc.

### Time and space complexity
