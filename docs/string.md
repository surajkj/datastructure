### String
Strings, which are widely used in Java programming, are a sequence of characters. In the Java programming language, strings are objects.
The most direct way to create a string is to write:
```
String greeting = "Hello world!";
```
As with any other object, you can create String objects by using the new keyword and a constructor

```
char[] helloArray = { 'h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '.' };
String helloString = new String(helloArray);
System.out.println(helloString);
```
